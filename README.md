# Dev Toolbox

A small web application that offers two developer tools:
- **JSON Formatter:** Input raw JSON text and get prettified, indented JSON output. Shows error if JSON is invalid.
- **Base64 Encoder/Decoder:** Encode plain text to Base64 and decode Base64 back to plain text.

---

## Features

- React.js frontend with 2-tab interface (JSON Formatter | Base64 Encoder/Decoder)
- Backend API built with Node.js and Express
- Basic error handling and user experience improvements
- Styled using Tailwind CSS
- Optional bonus: Dark mode toggle, clipboard copy button, and more (if implemented)

---

## How to run the app

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tiwariadarsh04/dev-toolbox.git

2. cd dev-toolbox/server
npm install
node index.js
3. cd ../client
npm install
npm start

What I'd improve with more time
Add user authentication to track JSON submissions per user

Store processed JSON data in a database and create a page to view all submissions

Add Docker setup for easier deployment

Host the app live on platforms like Vercel or Render

Enhance UI/UX with animations and better mobile responsiveness
